## DSA-Assignments

Structured implementations and practice exercises focused on core Data Structures & Algorithms concepts.  
This repository reflects consistent learning, problem-solving, and applied understanding of foundational DSA principles.


###  Overview

A curated collection of academic DSA assignments and self-practice programs,  
designed to reinforce algorithmic thinking and efficient data handling techniques.


###  Highlights

• Core data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs)  
• Algorithm fundamentals (sorting, searching, recursion, complexity analysis)  
• Clean, modular, and readability-oriented code  
• Lab-based exercises + extended practice tasks
